The title **"Progress analysis"** is located in the middle of the right-sided part of the page. On the left side, next to the title is a graph that explains how to understand student progress.

The chart demonstrates a student's earned honors within a certain time lapse: 
1. If a number of honors stable, it means that a student does not solve any Codewars tasks.
2. If a deviation is slight, it means that a student does few number of Codewars tasks.
3. If a deviation line goes sharply up, it illustrates that a student has performed a few number of Codewars tasks successfully.

Under the heading **"Progress analysis"** is the following text:
**“One glance at the chart is enough to understand the current state of the student”**.
