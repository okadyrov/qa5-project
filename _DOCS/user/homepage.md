The title called  **"System that considers individual features of each student"** is placed in the middle of the left-sided part of the page. The word combination of **"individual features"** is highlighted by a green color to emphasize the importance of the information.

On the right side, the following text is located: "We analyze educational process, your success and fails, test knowledge and push you to the next step." Underneath with a smaller font the following text is placed: "Each student’s profile shows his progress, completed tasks, and daily reports."

Next to those texts, a screenshot of student Alice Moon’s **progress monitor** is based. It demonstrates **the overview of a student’s progress** that includes the following information:
1. Student’s first and last names (here, Alice Moon);
2. Icons of Google Docs, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Codewars;
3. The number of a group a student belongs to (here, QA4);
4. About (information about student’s education, skills, and experience);
5. Goals;
6. Completed challenges (here, a list of completed katas is 461);
7. Day reports (here, a number of submitted reports is 95).

The chart illustrates the correlation between student’s efforts (completed katas) within time (days). In addition, it contains the following data: student’s rank (here, 3 kyu), honors (here, 2325), number of completed katas (here, 473), skills, and roles (here, student).
